Welcome!  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/cs/department/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de). I am hosted by [Martin Bichler](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/bichler/) at the [Chair of Decision Sciences & Systems](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/home/).  

Before this, I spent two wonderful years at the [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) in Amsterdam, hosted by [Guido Sch√§fer](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~schaefer/) in the [Networks & Optimization (N&O)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/networks-and-optimization/) group.  I completed my PhD in 2023 at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs) of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs), where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Vangelis Markakis](http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/).  

I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of computer science and economics, with a particular interest in algorithmic mechanism design, auctions, and online algorithms.

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/academic-cv.pdf).
