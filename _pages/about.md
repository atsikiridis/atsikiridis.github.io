I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/). I am very  fortunate to be hosted by [Guido Schaefer](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~schaefer/) in the [Networks & Optimization (N&O)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/networks-and-optimization/) group. I enjoy working on problems lying in the intersection of theoretical computer science, operations research and economics. I have a a particular interest in algorithmic mechanism design and discrete optimization.


In 2023, I completed my PhD in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs) of [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Vangelis Markakis](http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/) and be part of AUEB's [Theory Group](http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/othersites/TheoryGroup/index.html). Here is my [CV]().
