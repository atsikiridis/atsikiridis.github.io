In November, I will be attending the <a href="https://www.slmath.org/workshops/1082">Algorithms, Approximation, and Learning in Market and Mechanism Design</a> Workshop at the Simons Laufer Institute (former MSRI) in Berkeley. I will also be presenting a <a href="/assets/pdf/slmath.pdf">poster</a>.
